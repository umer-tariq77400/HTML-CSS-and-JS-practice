# Harbor Light Community Center Website: Adding Accessibility and Structured Data

## Project Overview

This project is a static website for the Harbor Light Community Center. It provides information about the center's services, events, and contact details. The website is designed with a focus on accessibility, semantic HTML, and structured data to ensure a user-friendly and inclusive experience.

## Key Features

1. **Accessibility Enhancements**:

   - Use of `aria-label` for navigation to improve screen reader support.
   - Proper use of `alt` attributes for images to describe their content.
   - Semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to structure the content meaningfully.
   - Inclusion of `role="contentinfo"` for the footer section to enhance accessibility.

2. **Structured Data**:

   - Implementation of schema.org microdata to provide structured information about the organization, services, and events.
   - Example:
     - `itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"` for the "About Us" and "Contact Us" sections.
     - `itemtype="http://schema.org/Service"` for the "Our Services" section.
     - `itemtype="http://schema.org/Event"` for the "Join Our Events" section.

3. **Responsive Design**:

   - Use of the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag to ensure the website is mobile-friendly.
   - CSS styles designed to adapt to different screen sizes.

4. **Content Organization**:
   - Clear navigation menu with links to different sections of the page.
   - Logical grouping of content into sections for better readability and usability.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Accessibility**:

   - Add keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.
   - Include skip links to allow users to bypass repetitive content.

2. **Improved Responsiveness**:

   - Use CSS media queries to further optimize the layout for various screen sizes and orientations.

3. **Dynamic Features**:

   - Implement JavaScript for interactive elements like a carousel for events or a contact form with validation.

4. **SEO Optimization**:

   - Add Open Graph meta tags for better social media sharing.
   - Optimize content for search engines by including more descriptive meta tags.

5. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Minify CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Use lazy loading for images to improve page load times.

6. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Add support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse audience.

This project demonstrates a strong foundation in accessibility and semantic web design, with room for further enhancements to improve user experience and functionality.
