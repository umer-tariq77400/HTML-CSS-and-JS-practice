# Global Adventures Website

This project is a website for Global Adventures, a fictional travel company. It allows users to explore information about various cities, contact the company, and subscribe to updates.

## HTML Pages

The website consists of the following main HTML files:

- **`index.html`**: The main landing page (homepage) of the Global Adventures website. (Assumed, based on navigation links)
- **`islamabad.html`**: This page is intended to provide information about Islamabad, including travel details, attractions, and specific offerings related to the city.
- **`lahore.html`**: This page is intended to provide information about Lahore, covering its travel aspects, local attractions, and relevant services.
- **`karachi.html`**: This page is intended to provide information about Karachi, focusing on travel opportunities, points of interest, and related content.
- **`contact.html`**: This page features a contact form enabling users to send messages or inquiries to Global Adventures. The form collects the user's name, email address, and a message.
- **`subscription.html`**: This page allows users to subscribe to Global Adventures for newsletters, updates, and promotional offers. It includes a form to collect the user's email address and requires an agreement to terms and conditions.

## Styling and Scripting

- **`styles.css`**: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the visual appearance of the website.
- **`script.js`**: Intended for JavaScript code to add interactive features and dynamic content to the website.

## Accessibility & SEO

The pages include ARIA roles and properties for better accessibility and meta tags for SEO, such as descriptions and keywords.

## Project Structure and Files

- **`index.html`**: This is the main HTML file that provides the structure and content of the blog page. It contains the text, images, and layout elements.
- **`style.css`**: This CSS file is responsible for the visual styling of the blog page. It controls the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall presentation of the content defined in `index.html`.
- **`script.js`**: This JavaScript file can be used to add interactivity to the blog page. (Currently, its specific use would depend on the project's current state; if it's empty, it's a placeholder for future dynamic features).
