Simple analog clock demo.

- Open `index.html` in a browser to see the clock.
- The clock uses `script.js` to set the rotation of the hands in real time.
- The design uses `clock.png` as the clock face image and CSS for the hands.

Accessibility:
- The clock respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting and will stop animating for users who prefer reduced motion.
